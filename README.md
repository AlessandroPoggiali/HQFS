# HQFS
Hybrid Quantum Feature Selection with Variance Estimation

The Hybrid Quantum Feature Selection (HQFS) algorithm exploits the variance estimation techniques, **QVAR** and **ML-QVAR**, to provide a hybrid quantum-classical version of the variance filter feature selection. In particular, the **QVAR** quantum subroutine computes the variance of the given feature using the Amplitude Estimation algorithm, while the **ML-QVAR** subroutine computes the variance of the given feature using the Amplitude Estimation algorithm with the *Maximum Likelihood Estimator* postprocessing.
